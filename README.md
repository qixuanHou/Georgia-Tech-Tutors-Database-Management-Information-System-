# Georgia-Tech-Tutors-Database-Management-Information-System-
 Designed the database management information system with MySQL and Python


Meagan Gadreault, April Hsieh, Ryan Youngblood, Qiran Zhu and I used MySQL and Python to analyze, 
specify, design, implement, document, and demonstrate a database management information system 
called Georgia Tech Tutors (GTT). We followed three phases as Classical Methodology Database 
Development: Analysis & Specification, Design, and Implementation & Testing. The system was 
implemented using a Database Management System (DBMS) that supports standard SQL queries.
